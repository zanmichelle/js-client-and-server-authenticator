# Old auth system i used to manage apps to sell or give access to

## how it works ?

### it uses discord.js and some other Node.js modules to run, its ran on express module. Interaction between client and server is thru requests.

- basically thru javascript client - server connection. 
- Its basic level of encryption
- cross checks requirements of server to client data (token, application that its trying to run, sha256 files size, etc)
- let user run the app


# This was possible thanks to an old friend, would love to post credit but i cant remember your discord tag xd...
